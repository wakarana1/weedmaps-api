Weedmaps API Code Challenge

- [x] Create a service that stores users, med rec, and id's.

- [X] This service should allow a user to upload, update, and delete med rec and id data.

- [X] Store users' name, email, and dob.

- [X] Store the med rec number, issuer, state, expiration date, and path to the image.

- [X] Store the id number, state, expiration date, and path to the image.

- [X] If the med rec or Id is expired, return expired.

### NOTES:

  I didn't get some of the questions I emailed to ruby-code-challenge answered, so instead, I made some assumptions that may or may not have been what was wanted.

  - Users can only have one Identification and one Medical Recommendation on file and any new ones would overwrite the existing ones on file
  - I am assuming that the Medical Recommendation and Identification numbers are numerical only
